Hi! I am Miki, and I am the creator of this git repository.

Inside of this repository is a project that I had been working on from the Odin Project. The website isn't as good as others, and commits and code of the website isn't at a great level. (I started coding 1 month ago, spare me)

The html files are the codes to my recipe website and hope you enjoy.
