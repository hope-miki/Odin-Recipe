        <h1>Fried Egg Tortilla</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all 
            in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, 
            jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions–and 
            enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of 
            course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if 
            you have company.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoon of butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 1/2 shredded chedar cheese</li>
            <li>1 flour tortilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium
                heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
            <li>Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until 
                egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 
                1 minute.</li>
            <li>Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle 
                with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.</li>
            <li>Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 
                1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and 
                tortilla, as one.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue 
                cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla
                is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
